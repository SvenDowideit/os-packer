# Packer Build Scripts for RancherOS
---

## Purpose

These scripts are used to build RancherOS for Vagrant, Amazon and GCE.

## Release process

Once you have pushed the `rancher/os:vX.Y.Z` image to the hub,
update the `RANCHEROS_VERSION` version in the `Dockerfile.dapper` to match.

Then run `make test-build` to publish a private test version of the optimised
and un-optimised AMI's to Amazon. Test these by making new EC2 machines.

Once that's tested you can go on to publish the full set of AMI's and the GCE image
using `make release`. (and for now, you need to upload the gce image using
`gsutil cp ./rancheros-${RANCHEROS_VERSION}.tar.gz gs://ros-images/`.
